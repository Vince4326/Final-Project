# Vincent S. ‚Äì Final Portfolio Project

## About Me  
Hello! I'm Vincent S., a high school junior currently enrolled in AP Computer Science Principles. This year, I explored both the creative and logical sides of coding by building projects that range from simple applications to interactive games. In addition to programming, I enjoy drawing, working on my car, and learning new tech skills that help me grow as a developer.

## About This Project  
This portfolio project is the final showcase of my work from AP Computer Science Principles. It includes a collection of JavaScript-based projects I created throughout the year using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Building this portfolio helped me reinforce my understanding of front-end development, responsive design, and how to embed projects from platforms like CodePen. I also learned how to host websites using GitHub Pages and how to manage a codebase using Git and GitHub.

## Portfolio Overview  
My portfolio site features a clean and organized layout that introduces who I am, what I‚Äôve learned, and highlights several of my favorite coding projects. It is designed to be accessible, informative, and visually appealing. Each project is displayed using an embedded CodePen preview, along with a short description of what the project does and how it was built.

## Featured Projects  

- **Clock**  
  A stylish blue analog clock that shows the current time. It uses JavaScript to animate the clock hands in real-time.

- **Blackjack**  
  A digital version of the classic card game. The player draws cards and tries to reach 21 without going over. Built with conditionals and logic in JavaScript.

- **Pong**  
  A two-player version of the arcade classic. The game uses keyboard controls and collision detection, all built from scratch using JavaScript and HTML5.

- **Password Generator**  
  A tool that instantly creates strong, random passwords using a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Uses `Math.random()` to ensure randomness.
